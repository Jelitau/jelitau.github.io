    <h1> Hiiii to my Play Ground, User </h1>

    <p>I'm currently thinking of using this first website primarely as a play ground and test-side, to learn the
        languages HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheeets) and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Therefore the content on this site might change from time to time and is not bound to a specific topic.</p>

    <p> Here I got an Image into my website :D </p>
    <p> And even an image can be a link: </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.de" title="Yep. That's the Google search engine.">
        <img src="images/sunset.png" alt="A sunset.">
    </a>

    <p>Here I'm trying to add an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>This is not a banana.</li>
        <li>not(not(This is a list item.))</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope that concludes the list.</p>

    <p>Here I'm trying to add an ordered list:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>As the first item, I will always be at the top.</li>
        <li>This is not a banana, but this is indeed the second list item of an ordered list.</li>
        <li>I'm the worst.... ehhh last.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I hope that concludes the second list.</p>

    <p>Next up: I learned how to add a link to my website:
        <a href="https://elite0knight.github.io/">This</a> is a Link to a user study, that I currently have to develop
        in the course "Human Computer Interaction".
    </p>

    <p>Then I learned something interesting: The characters &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, &apos; &amp; &amp; have a special
        meaning in html, so in order to print them, you have to use so called entity references like "&amp;amp;"" for
        &amp;.
    </p>
