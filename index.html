    <h1> My Web Development Play Ground </h1>
    <img src="images/sunset.png" alt="A sunset.">
    <p>I'm currently thinking of using this first website primarely as a play ground and test-side, to learn the
        languages HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheeets) and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Therefore the content on this site might change from time to time and is not bound to a specific topic.</p>


    <p>Here I'm trying to add an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
        <li>This is not a banana.</li>
        <li>not(not(This is a list item.))</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope that concludes the list.</p>

    <p>Here I'm trying to add an ordered list:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>As the first item, I will always be at the top.</li>
        <li>This is not a banana, but this is indeed the second list item of an ordered list.</li>
        <li>I'm the worst.... ehhh last.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I hope that concludes the second list.</p>

    <p>Next up: I learned how to add a link to my website:
        <a href="https://elite0knight.github.io/">This</a> is a Link to my own Website, using the hypertext reference
        attribute on the anchor element "This"
    </p>
